-2 ABOUT BOX: yes but you used a MessageBox instead of creating a separate window in XAML.

TEXT FROM RESOURCES: yes

-10 DATA FROM RESOURCE: no

Had code to load data into list. There was supposed to be a resource that automatically updated the list in the UI without the need for code.

-10 APPEARANCE FROM STYLE SHEET: no

Seemed to have code in MainWindow.cs that set some appearance values. This is worse than hard-coding appearance in your XAML because programers will expect appearance to be set in XAML, not code.

LONG RUNNING PROCESS: yes

EVIDENCE UI REMAINS ACTIVE: yes

OTHER ISSUES:
-5 "edit" button caused program to crash

"New Task" button didn't seem to add a task of the same format as the original 3.

-5 I found your code very hard to follow.
